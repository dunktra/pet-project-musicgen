   cd pet-project-musicgen
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```

### Important Notes:
- **No need to clone Meta's Audiocraft repository**: The app will automatically download the required MusicGen model (e.g., `facebook/musicgen-small`) from Metaâ€™s servers when the app is first run.
- Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to allow Audiocraft to fetch the model during runtime. 

This will set up and run the app, allowing you to generate music based on natural language input!
